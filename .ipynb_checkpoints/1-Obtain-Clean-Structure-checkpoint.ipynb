    "## Mic check / Introduction\n",
    "Rap music has been one of the most influential music genres for the biggest part of the last quarter century. It all started by the name of \"Rhythm and Poetry\", meaning, words mean the world here. This data analysis will try to shed more light on the way the most influential rappers, well, rap.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to analyze 5 songs per rapper. We analyze 7 rappers, meaning our data will contain lyrics from 35 songs. The goal of our analysis is to make conclusions on the positivity and the subjectivity of the rappers, as well as the size of their vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project, as hopefully every other data science project, will go through the notorious process of \"Data Cleaning\". It's boring and all that, yet it's absoulutely vital for the sanity of our results. If you put sour food in the juicer, you can't really expect not to get sour juice, right? Feed a model with bad data, it feeds you with bad results. In the world of data science, it's almost impossible to completely clean your data, yet we should always try to minimize the garbage, so we can maximize the correctness of our output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clean data is not enough. We need properly structured data. Why? Well, algorithms have a thing for properly structured data. Organizing data in the right way makes it easier for algorithms to extract better information.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that the choice of rappers and songs is totally subjective. You could to this analysis for any musician, author, poet or any other text content producer. Good luck with cleaning data for mumble rap lyrics though.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, let's see the final list of steps we will go through before we actually do some really cool stuff with our data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Optain data\n",
    "2. Clean data\n",
    "3. Structure data\n",
    "    1. **Corpus** - collection of song lyrics from every rapper\n",
    "   \n",
    "    2. **Word Matrix** - matrix format of every word used in the Corpus\n",
    "    \n",
    "As we will notice, the \"Clean data\" and \"Structure data\" steps are dependent and could be executed in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, two days ago, on June 16, it was Tupac's birthday. So this is my way of saying \"Happy birthday, man\". Legends never die.\n",
    "\n",
