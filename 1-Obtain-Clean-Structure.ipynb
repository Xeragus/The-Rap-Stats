    "## Mic check / Introduction\n",
    "Rap music has been one of the most influential music genres for the biggest part of the last quarter century. It all started by the name of \"Rhythm and Poetry\", meaning, words mean the world here. This data analysis will try to shed more light on the way the most influential rappers, well, rap.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to analyze 5 songs per rapper. We analyze 6 rappers, meaning our data will contain lyrics from 30 songs. The goal of our analysis is to make conclusions on the positivity and the subjectivity of the rappers, as well as the size of their vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project, as hopefully every other data science project, will go through the notorious process of \"Data Cleaning\". It's boring and all that, yet it's absoulutely vital for the sanity of our results. If you put sour food in the juicer, you can't really expect not to get sour juice, right? Feed a model with bad data, it feeds you with bad results. In the world of data science, it's almost impossible to completely clean your data, yet we should always try to minimize the garbage, so we can maximize the correctness of our output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clean data is not enough. We need properly structured data. Why? Well, algorithms have a thing for properly structured data. Organizing data in the right way makes it easier for algorithms to extract better information.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that the choice of rappers and songs is totally subjective. You could to this analysis for any musician, author, poet or any other text content producer. Good luck with cleaning data for mumble rap lyrics though.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, let's see the final list of steps we will go through before we actually do some really cool stuff with our data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Optain data\n",
    "2. Clean data\n",
    "3. Structure data\n",
    "    1. **Corpus** - collection of song lyrics from every rapper\n",
    "   \n",
    "    2. **Word Matrix** - matrix format of every word used in the Corpus\n",
    "    \n",
    "As we will notice, the \"Clean data\" and \"Structure data\" steps are dependent and could be executed in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, two days ago, on June 16, it was Tupac's birthday. So this is my way of saying \"Happy birthday, man\".\n",

I\\'m drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel I\\'ma sleep in the front seat Bumpin\\' Heavy D and the Boyz, still \"Chunky but Funky\" But in my head there\\'s something I can feel tugging and struggling Angels fight with devils, and here\\'s what they want from me They\\'re askin\\' me to eliminate some of the women hate But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have, then you may be a little patient And more sympathetic to the situation And understand the discrimination But fuck it, life\\'s handin\\' you lemons? Make lemonade then! But if I can\\'t batter the women How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then? Don\\'t mistake him for Satan; it\\'s a fatal mistake If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and Don\\'t be a retard! Be a king? Think not Why be a king when you can be a God? I am phenomenal With every ounce of my blood With every breath in my lungs Won\\'t stop until I\\'m phe-no-menal I am phenomenal However long that it takes I\\'ll go to whatever lengths It\\'s gonna make me a monster though I am phenomenal But I\\'ll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’ Cause I\\'m born to be phenomenalUnstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles Untoppable thoughts, fuckin\\' juggernaut that\\'ll Stomp you in a verse, obstacles I\\'m drawn to \\'em When the going got rough Some of what I done fought through was the worst, little sissy Who the fuck taught you how to persevere?

And put in twice what you get back from this shit Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give Rap is my shiv But it\\'s like my shield at the same time I wield and my knife is will Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill How I can just kill a cypher, survivor\\'s guilt I rhyme like life is still an uphill climb Ready to face any challenge, waitin\\' Can taste it, it\\'s salivation, I\\'m wagin\\' retaliation Look what I have built, reputation is validation The only thing I\\'m capable of makin\\' is amazing Only thing you\\'re capable of makin\\' is a false statement Or accusation...

Have nothin\\', get it all but too much of it Then lose it again, did I swallow hallucinogens? ‘Cause if not, where the hell did it go? ‘Cause here I sit in Lucifer’s den by the dutch oven Just choosing to sin, even if it means I\\'m sellin\\' my soul Just to be the undisputed again Do whatever I gotta do just to win ‘Cause I got this motherfuckin\\' cloud over my head Crown around it, thorns on it Cracks in it, bet you morons didn\\'t think I\\'d be back, did ya? How \\'bout that? I’m somehow now back to the underdog But no matter how loud that I bark This sport is somethin\\' I never bow-out at I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it\\'s a love-hate But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt Even when you bitches are countin\\' me out And I appear to be down for the count Only time I ever been out and about Is drivin\\' around town with my fuckin\\' whereabouts in a doubt ‘Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here But I\\'m not a quitter; gotta get up, give it all I got or give up Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept goin\\' I\\'m tryna be headstrong But it feels like I slept on my neck wrong ‘Cause you\\'re moving onto the next, but is your respect gone? ‘Cause someone told me that…Kings never dieDon\\'t give me that sob story, liar, don\\'t preach to the choir You ain\\'t never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer Wouldn\\'t even take shit into consideration Obliterate anyone in the way I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features And try to show out on a track with me But it\\'d actually have to be A fuckin\\' blow-out to get me to retire Tell these new artists that kings never die I know shit has changed in this age, fuck a Twitter page Did it just say I\\'ve been upstaged? Why am I online? It\\'s driving me crazy I\\'m ridin\\' shotgun tryna get a gauge On what\\'s hot, but I\\'m not one to conform But as days pass in this shit And opinions sway, I can hear \\'em say If I stay passionate maybe I can stage a miraculous Comeback, as if I went away But detractors just say so much for the renegade Someone\\'s gonna make me blow my composure Here I go again, center stage, and I feel like I\\'m in a cage They so want a champion to fall It\\'s no wonder why I laugh at \\'em ‘Cause why can\\'t we win \\'em all? So fuck what these cynics say! It just goes to show that when my back\\'s against the wall And I\\'m under attack again, that I\\'ll act as if I\\'m \\'posed ta With this pent-up rage, ‘cause all these plaques in my office On the floor stacked against the door Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin\\' back again? ‘Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards And trophies, they just don\\'t mean jack anymore If I\\'m here today and gone tomorrow, and I\\'m not gonna be…Here to stay Even when I\\'m gone When I close my eyes Through the passage of time Kings never dieI want it, I\\'m comin\\' to get it So you son of a bitches don\\'t duck You’re gonna get Riddick Bowe’d Critics\\'ll end up in critical Think your shit is dope, all you\\'re gonna get is smoked And I ain\\'t stopping \\'til I\\'m on top again All alone and on a throne, like a token of respect Or a homage poem, or an ode I\\'ve been owed Tossed in the air by my own arm And launched so hard it broke my collarbone And when it\\'s my time to go I\\'m still not leaving, stop for no one, I don\\'t know But I\\'ve been told, an obstacle that blocks your road, ya Knock it over, time to go for the pot of gold, ‘cause…They say kings never die Just ask Jam Master Jay They just grow wings and they fly So, hands up, reach for the sky! Try to hold on and prolong these moments ‘Cause in a blink of an eye They\\'ll be overSo you\\'re tryna secure your legacy like Shakur And ensure nobody\\'s ever gonna be what you were So before you\\'re leavin\\' this Earth You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral, berserk Deacon of words, syllable genius at work Plus, I\\'m thinkin\\' that they\\'re mistakin\\' my kindness for weakness; kill \\'em with meanness I went from powdered milk and Farina To flippin\\' burgers on the grill for some peanuts At Gilbert\\'s to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas Still appeal to the dreamers I made it to the silverscreen But Rocky\\'s still what the theme is Khalil on the beat, ‘cause makin\\' the beat Ain’t the same feelin\\' to me as killin\\' the beat is Or fulfillin\\' to me is what fillin\\' a seat is It\\'s that sound-bombing, thirstin\\' howl Common, underground, Diamond D, Outsidaz Stomach growl, throbbin\\' hunger, out-rhymin\\' everyone God, just give me one shot, I swear that I won\\'t let you down I\\'ma be around forever-and-a-day, even in the ground You ain\\'t never ever gonna hear \\'em say I ain\\'t…Here to stay Even when I\\'m gone When I close my eyes Through the passage of time Kings never dieKings never die *Plane crash* Yeah (Illa) Yo, I\\'m just gonna write down my first thoughts, and see where this takes me, ’cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin\\' face right now YeahLet me explain just how to make greatness Straight out the gate, I\\'m ’bout to break it down Ain\\'t no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I\\'m \\'bout To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows If I press the issue just to get the anger out (Brrr!) Full magazine could take Staples out Savage but ain\\'t thinkin\\' \\'bout no bank account But bitch, I\\'m off the chain like Kala Brown Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I’m talkin’, lil\\' bitch I’m sorry, wait, what\\'s your talent? Oh, critiquin\\' My talent? Oh, bitch, I don\\'t know who the fuck y’all are To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion or view You mention me, millions of views, attention in news I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you Billions of views, your ten cents are two Skim through the music to give shit reviews To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse Don\\'t get misconstrued, business as us\\' Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do Or get dissed \\'cause I just don\\'t get What the fuck half the shit is that you\\'re listenin\\' to Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow Everyone copies though? Prob\\'ly no Get this fuckin\\' audio out my Audi, yo, adiós I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though Not even dissin\\', it just ain\\'t for me All I am simply is just an emcee Maybe \"Stan\" just isn\\'t your cup of tea (Get it?) Maybe your cup\\'s full of syrup and lean Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably Shake the world up if it were up to me Paul wants me to chill, y\\'all want me to ill I should eat a pill, probably I will Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death I breathe on the mirror, I don\\'t see my breath Possibly I\\'m dead, I must be possessed Like an evil spell, I\\'m E-V-I-L (Evil, spelled) Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch Like Vice President Mike Pence Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip These are things that I\\'d rather do than hear you on a mic Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and Jesus Christ, man, how many times is Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!) You won\\'t ever see Em icy But as cold as I get on the M-I-C I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (Yeah) Turn down for what? I ain\\'t loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up! \\'Cause I don\\'t know how I\\'m gonna get your mouths to shut Now when it doesn\\'t matter what caliber I spit at, I\\'ll bet a hundred thousand bucks You\\'ll turn around and just be like, \"Man, how the fuck Sourpuss gonna get mad just \\'cause his album sucks? And now he wants to take it out on us.\" (Ooouuu) But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study It\\'ll help me get back to myself and she\\'ll love me (Oooouuu) I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that I\\'d just be like everyone else in the fuckin\\' industry Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing) So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg\\' Azae\\' Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name I\\'m fed up with bein\\' humble And rumor is I\\'m hungry, I\\'m sure you heard rumblings I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach I heard your mumblin\\' but it\\'s jumbled in mumbo-jumbo The era that I\\'m from will pummel you, that\\'s what it\\'s comin\\' to What the fuck you\\'re gonna do when you run into it? I\\'m gonna crumble you and I\\'ll take a number two And dump on you, if you ain\\'t Joyner If you ain\\'t Kendrick or Cole or Sean, then you\\'re a goner I\\'m \\'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald\\'s But if you\\'re lookin\\' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival But y\\'all are actin\\' like I tried to serve you up a slider Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned And you woulda bought it But sayin\\' I no longer got it \\'Cause you missed a line and never caught it \\'Cause it went over your head, because you\\'re too stupid to get it \\'Cause you\\'re mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest With your expertise and knowledge, but you\\'ll never be an artist And I\\'m harder on myself than you could ever be regardless What I\\'ll never be is flawless, all I\\'ll ever be is honest Even when I\\'m gone they\\'re gonna say I brought it Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin\\' alcoholic With a bottle full of malt liquor But I couldn\\'t bottle this shit any longer The fact that I know that I\\'ma hit my bottom If I don\\'t pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet I don\\'t see why y\\'all even started with me I get in beefs, my enemies die I don\\'t cease fire \\'til at least all are deceased I\\'m east side, never be caught slippin\\' Now you see why I don\\'t sleep, not even a wink, I don\\'t blink I don\\'t doze off, I don\\'t even nod to the beats I don\\'t even close my fuckin\\' eyes when I sneeze \"Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage The Thing ain\\'t even orange—oh my God, that\\'s a reach!\" Shout to all my colorblind people Each and everyone of y\\'all, if you call a fire engine green Aquamarine, or you think water is pink \"Dawg, that\\'s a date.\"  \"Looks like an olive to me.\" \"Look, there\\'s an apple!\" No, it\\'s not, it\\'s a peach!

(Yeah) Invite \\'em in like a One A Day I\\'m not done (Preach!) \\'Cause I feel like the beast of burden That line in the sand, was it even worth it? \\'Cause the way I see people turning\\'s Makin\\' it seem worthless, it\\'s startin\\' to defeat the purpose I\\'m watchin\\' my fan base shrink to thirds And I was just tryin\\' to do the right thing, but word Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict Or still yet to be determined? \\'Cause I\\'m determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped But if I could go back, I\\'d at least reword it And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent Sold the dream to that he\\'s deserted But I think it\\'s workin\\' These verses are makin\\' him a wee bit nervous And he\\'s too scurred to answer me with words \\'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered But I know at least he\\'s heard it \\'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin\\' him Or ask if I\\'m linked to terrorists I said, \"Only when it comes to ink and lyricists.\" But my beef is more media journalists (Hold up, hold up, hold up…) I said my beef is more meaty, a journalist Can get a mouthful of flesh And yes, I mean eatin\\' a penis \\'Cause they been pannin\\' my album to death So I been givin\\' the media fingers Don\\'t wanna turn this to a counseling sesh But they been puttin\\' me through the ringer So I ain\\'t ironin\\' shit out with the press But I just took this beat to the cleaners'"

these crazy nights Whether you wrong or you right A motherfucker still love you still feel you Still there for you no matter what hehe You will always be in my heart with unconditional loveCome listen to my truest thoughts my truest feelings All my peers doin years beyond drug dealing How many caskets can we witness Before we see its hard to live this life without God So we must ask forgiveness Ask Mama why I got this urge to die Witness the tears fallin free from my eyes before she could reply Though we were born without a silver spoon My broken down TV show cartoons in my living room hey One day I hope to make it a player in this game Mama dont cry long as we try maybe things change Perhaps its just a fantasy A life where we dont need no welfare and share with our whole family Maybe its me that caused it the fightin and the hurtin In my room cryin because I didnt wanna be a burden Watch Mama open up her arms to hug me And I aint worried bout a damn thing with unconditional loveIn this game the lessons in your eyes to see Though things change the futures still inside of me We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark So you will always be in my heart with unconditional love In this game the lessons in your eyes to see Though things change the futures still inside of me We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark So you will always be in my heart with unconditional loveJust got the message youve been callin all week Been out here hustlin on these streets Aint had a chance to speak But you know with you and me its all G We could never be enemies Cause youve been such a good friend to me Where would I be without my dogs No wonder why when times get hard Cause it aint easy bein who we are Driven by my ambitions desire higher positions So I proceed to make Gs eternally And my mission is to be more than just a rap musician The elevation of todays generation if I could make em listen Prison aint what we need no longer stuck in greed Time to plan strategize my familys gotta eat We work somethin out of nothin No pleasure in the sufferin Neighborhood would be good if they could cut out all the bustin The liquor and the weed the cussin Sendin love out to my block The struggle never stops unconditional loveIn this game the lessons in your eyes to see Though things change the futures still inside of me We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark So you will always be in my heart with unconditional love In this game the lessons in your eyes to see Though things change the futures still inside of me We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark So you will always be in my heart with unconditional loveIll probably never understand your ways With everyday I swear I hear you tryin to change your ways While gettin paid at the same time Just had a baby with the same eyes Somethin inside please let me die these are strange times How come I never made it Maybe its the way I played it in my heart I knew one day I gotta be a star My hopes and all my wishes so many vivid pictures And all the currency Ill never even get to see This fast life soon shatters cause after all the lights and screams nothin but my dreams matter Hopin for better days maybe a peaceful night Baby dont cry cause everything gon be alright Just lay your head on my shoulder Dont worry bout a thing baby girl Im a soldier huh Never treated me bad no matter who I was You still came with that unconditional love repeat to fade In this game the lessons in your eyes to see Though things change the futures still inside of me We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark So you will always be in my heart with unconditional love In this game the lessons in your eyes to see Though things change the futures still inside of me We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark So you will always be in my heart with unconditional love I see no changes wake up in the morning and I ask myself Is life worth livin Should I blast myself Im tired of bein poor and even worse Im black My stomach hurts so Im lookin for a purse to snatch Cops give a damn about a negro Pull the trigger kill a nigga hes a hero Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares One less hungry mouth on the welfare First ship em dope and let em deal to brothers Give em guns step back watch em kill each other Its time to fight back thats what Huey said Two shots in the dark now Hueys dead I got love for my brother But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other We gotta start makin changes Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers And thats how its supposed to be How can the Devil take a brother if hes close to me Id love to go back to when we played as kids But things change and thats the way it isThats just the way it is Thingsll never be the same Thats just the way it is aww yeah Thats just the way it is Thingsll never be the same Thats just the way it is aww yeahI see no changes all I see is racist faces Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races We under I wonder what it takes to make this One better place lets erase the wasted Take the evil out the people theyll be actin right Cause both black and white are smokin crack tonight And the only time we chill is when we kill each other It takes skill to be real time to heal each other And although it seems heavensent We aint ready to see a black president It aint a secret dont conceal the fact The penitentiarys packed and its filled with blacks But some things will never change Try to show another way but you stayin in the dope game Now tell me whats a mother to do Bein real dont appeal to the brother in you You gotta operate the easy way I made a G today but you made it in a sleazy way Sellin crack to the kids I gotta get paid — well hey but thats the way it isThats just the way it is Thingsll never be the same Thats just the way it is aww yeah Thats just the way it is Thingsll never be the same Thats just the way it is aww yeahWe gotta make a change Its time for us as a people to start makin some changes Lets change the way we eat Lets change the way we live And lets change the way we treat each other You see the old way wasnt workin So its on us to do what we gotta do to surviveAnd still I see no changes cant a brother get a little peace Its war on the streets and a war in the Middle East Instead of war on poverty They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me And I aint never did a crime I aint have to do But now Im back with the facts givin it back to you Dont let em jack you up back you up Crack you up and pimpsmack you up You gotta learn to hold your own They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone But tell the cops they cant touch this I dont trust this when they try to rush I bust this Thats the sound of my tool You say it aint cool my mama didnt raise no fool And as long as I stay black I gotta stay strapped And I never get to lay back Cause I always got to worry bout the payback Some buck that I roughed up way back Comin back after all these years Ratatattattattat thats the way it isThats just the way it is Thingsll never be the same Thats just the way it is aww yeah Youre my brother youre my sister Thats just the way it is Thingsll never be the same Thats just the way it is aww yeahSome thingsll never change Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side Somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die And even though we both came from the same places The money and the fame made us all change places How could it be Through the misery that came to pass The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask For currency but you could run to me when you need And Ill never leave honestly Someone to believe in as you can see Its a small thing to a true what could I do Real homies help you get through And come to knew hed do the same thing if he could Cause in the hood true homies make you feel good And half the times we be actin up call the cops Bringin a cease to the peace that was on my block It never stops when my mama ask me will I change I tell her yeah but its clear Ill always be the same Until the end of timeSo take these broken wings I need your hands to come and heal me once again Until the end of time So I can fly away until the end of time Until the end of time until the end of timePlease Lord forgive me for my life of sin My hard stare seem to scare all my sisters kids So you know I dont hang around the house much This allnight money makin got me outta touch Shit aint flashed a smile in a long while An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs My attitude got me walkin solo Ride out alone in my lolo Watchin the whole world move in slowmo For quiet times disappear listen to the ocean Smokin Ports think my thoughts then its back to coastin Who can I trust in this cold world My phony homie had a baby by my old girl But I aint trippin Im a player I aint sweatin him I sexed his sister had her mumble like a Mexican His next of kin no remorse it was meant to happen Besides rappin the only thing I did good was scrappin Until the end of timeSo take these broken wings I need your hands to come and heal me once again Until the end of time So I can fly away until the end of time Until the end of time until the end of timeNow whos to say if I was right or wrong To live my life as an outlaw all along Remain strong in this planet full of player haters They conversate but Death Row full of demonstrators And in the end drinkin Hennessy Made all my enemies envy me So cold when I flow eliminatin easily Falls to they knees they plead for they right to breathe While beggin me to keep the peace haha When I conceive closer to achieve In times of danger dont freeze time to be a G Follow my lead Ill supply everything you need An ounce of game and the training to make a G Remember me as an outcast Outlaw Another album out thats what Im about more Gettin raw til the day I see my casket Buried as a G while the whole world remembers me Until the end of timeSo take these broken wings I need your hands to come and heal me once again Until the end of time So I can fly away until the end of time Until the end of time until the end of time You are appreciated When I was young me and my mama had beef Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets Though back at the time I never thought Id see her face Aint a woman alive that could take my mamas place Suspended from school and scared to go home I was a fool With the big boys breakin all the rules I shed tears with my baby sister over the years We was poorer than the other little kids And even though we had different daddies the same drama When things went wrong wed blame Mama I reminisce on the stress I caused it was hell Huggin on my mama from a jail cell And whod think in elementary hey Id see the penitentiary one day And runnin from the police thats right Mama catch me put a whoopin to my backside And even as a crack fiend Mama You always was a black queen Mama I finally understand For a woman it aint easy tryin to raise a man You always was committed A poor single mother on welfare tell me how you did it Theres no way I can pay you back but the plan Is to show you that I understand you are appreciatedLady dont you know we love ya Dear Mama Sweet lady place no one above ya You are appreciated Sweet lady dont you know we love yaNow aint nobody tell us it was fair No love from my daddy cause the coward wasnt there He passed away and I didnt cry cause my anger Wouldnt let me feel for a stranger They say Im wrong and Im heartless but all along I was lookin for a father he was gone I hung around with the thugs And even though they sold drugs They showed a young brother love I moved out and started really hangin I needed money of my own so I started slangin I aint guilty cause even though I sell rocks It feels good puttin money in your mailbox I love payin rent when the rent is due I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you Cause when I was low you was there for me And never left me alone because you cared for me And I could see you comin home after work late Youre in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate You just workin with the scraps you was given And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin But now the road got rough youre alone Youre tryin to raise two bad kids on your own And theres no way I can pay you back but my plan Is to show you that I understand you are appreciatedLady dont you know we love ya Dear Mama Sweet lady place no one above ya You are appreciated Sweet lady dont you know we love yaPour out some liquor and I reminisce Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama And when it seems that Im hopeless You say the words that can get me back in focus When I was sick as a little kid To keep me happy theres no limit to the things you did And all my childhood memories Are full of all the sweet things you did for me And even though I act crazy I gotta thank the Lord that you made me There are no words that can express how I feel You never kept a secret always stayed real And I appreciate how you raised me And all the extra love that you gave me I wish I could take the pain away If you can make it through the night theres a brighter day Everything will be alright if you hold on Its a struggle every day gotta roll on And theres no way I can pay you back but my plan Is to show you that I understand you are appreciatedLady dont you know we love ya Dear Mama Sweet lady place no one above ya You are appreciated Sweet lady dont you know we love ya Dear Mama Sweet lady lady Dear Mama Lady lady'"

doodle enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times but i gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned rappers are hungry lookin at me like its lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like im on my pharoahe monch grind so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come tryin to censor you like that one line i said on im back from the mathers lp  when i tried to say ill take seven kids from columbine put em all in a line add an  a revolver and a  see if i get away with it now that i aint as big as i was but im morphin into an immortal comin through the portal youre stuck in a time warp from  though and i dont know what the fuck

curtains im inadvertently hurtin you how many verses i gotta murder to prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too ugh school flunky pill junkie but look at the

wrench while i take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch like vice president mike pence back up on my shit in a sidekick as i lay it on a spike strip these are things that id rather do than

into it im gonna crumble you and ill take a number two and dump on you if you aint joyner if you aint kendrick or cole or sean then youre a goner im bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it i guess when you walk into bk you expect a whopper you can order a quarter pounder when you go to mcdonalds but if youre lookin to get a porterhouse you better go get revival but yall are actin like i tried to serve you up a slider maybe the vocals shoulda been autotuned and you woulda bought it but sayin i no longer got it cause you missed a line and never caught it cause it went over your head because youre too stupid to get it cause youre mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest with your expertise and knowledge but youll never be an artist and im harder on myself than you could ever be regardless what ill never be is flawless all ill ever be is honest even when im gone theyre gonna say i brought it even when i hit my forties like a fuckin alcoholic with a bottle full of malt liquor but i couldnt bottle this shit any longer the fact that i know that ima hit my bottom if i dont pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet i dont see why yall even started

way i see people turnings makin it seem worthless its startin to defeat the purpose im watchin my fan base shrink to thirds and i was just tryin to do the right thing but word has the court of public opinion reached a verdict or still yet to be determined cause im determined to be me critiqued or worshipped but if i could go back id at least reword it and say i empathize with the people this evil serpent sold the dream to that hes deserted but i think its workin these verses are makin him a wee bit nervous and hes too scurred to answer me with words cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered but i know at least hes heard it cause agent orange just sent the secret service to meet in person to see if i really think of hurtin him or ask if im linked to terrorists i said only when it comes to ink and lyricists but my beef is more media journalists hold up hold up hold up i said my beef is more meaty a journalist can get a mouthful of flesh and yes i mean eatin a penis cause they been pannin my album to death so i been givin the media fingers dont wanna turn this to a counseling sesh but they been puttin me through the ringer so i aint ironin shit out with the press but i just
