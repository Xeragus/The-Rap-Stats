## Mic check / Introduction
Rap music has been one of the most influential music genres for the biggest part of the last quarter century. It all started by the name of "Rhythm and Poetry", meaning, words mean the world here. This data analysis will try to shed more light on the way the most influential rappers, well, rap. 

The purpose of this project is to analyze 5 songs per rapper. We analyze 6 rappers, meaning our data will contain lyrics from 30 songs. The goal of our analysis is to make conclusions on the positivity and the subjectivity of the rappers, as well as the size of their vocabulary.

This project, as hopefully every other data science project, will go through the notorious process of "Data Cleaning". It's boring and all that, yet it's absoulutely vital for the sanity of our results. If you put sour food in the juicer, you can't really expect not to get sour juice, right? Feed a model with bad data, it feeds you with bad results. In the world of data science, it's almost impossible to completely clean your data, yet we should always try to minimize the garbage, so we can maximize the correctness of our output.

Clean data is not enough. We need properly structured data. Why? Well, algorithms have a thing for properly structured data. Organizing data in the right way makes it easier for algorithms to extract better information.

It's worth noting that the choice of rappers and songs is totally subjective. You could to this analysis for any musician, author, poet or any other text content producer. Good luck with cleaning data for mumble rap lyrics though.

That said, let's see the final list of steps we will go through before we actually do some really cool stuff with our data:

1. Optain data
2. Clean data
3. Structure data
    1. **Corpus** - collection of song lyrics from every rapper
   
    2. **Word Matrix** - matrix format of every word used in the Corpus
    
As we will notice, the "Clean data" and "Structure data" steps are dependent and could be executed in parallel.

Next, we need a function that will take a URL and return the scraped text.


```python
# Function that takes a URL as parameter, scrapes the Genius page at that URL, extracts and returns the lyrics
def fetch_lyrics(url):
    print(url)
    
    page = requests.get(url)
    html = BeautifulSoup(page.text, "html.parser")
    lyrics = html.find("div", class_="lyrics").get_text()
    
    return lyrics
```

Now that we have a function, we will use it to fetch lyrics. This could take a couple of minutes. You will see the URL of the scraped page printed out.


```python
# We will store the lyrics in this dictionary
lyrics = {}
lyrics['tupac'] = [fetch_lyrics(url) for url in tupac_urls]

Now that we have scraped our data, we need to organize it. We will save the lyrics collection for every rapper in a separate file using Pickle, which we imported at the start. Pickle is used in Python for object serialization. The files will be saved in a directory that we will create, if it doesn't already exist.


```python
# Create the directory where we will keep the lyrics files
if not os.path.exists('lyrics'):
    os.makedirs('lyrics')
    
rappers = ['tupac', 'biggie', 'snoop', 'nas', 'game', 'fifty']

# Create named files
for i, rapper in enumerate(rappers):
    with open("lyrics/" + rapper + ".txt", "wb") as file:
        pickle.dump(lyrics[rapper], file)
```

We will read the data from the files and apply a few cleaning techniques to it.


```python
data = {}

for i, rapper in enumerate(rappers):
    with open("lyrics/" + rapper + ".txt", "rb") as file:
        data[rapper] = pickle.load(file)
```

At this point you could check if data was loaded correctly. We are done with obtaining data, now we proceed to the second step, cleaning data.


```python
data.keys()
```




    dict_keys(['tupac', 'biggie', 'snoop', 'nas', 'game', 'fifty'])




```python
data['tupac']
```

## 2. Clean Data 
The techniques used to clean textual data are called "text pre-processing techniques". We will use few of those, but won't go to any advanced data cleaning. We will go through the following techniques:
1. Remove garbage characters (like "/n", "[]" and so on)
2. Remove punctuation
3. Remove numerical values
4. Make all text lowercase
5. Remove stop words

First, we will structure the data in a better way. As noticed before, our data per rapper is a list of lyrics. So, we have to transform it into one single text. We will write a function that will accept a list of lyrics and will return one single text. That can only mean one thing...

## 3. Structure data
So, first we will merge our data into single text, and then we will put it in the following formats:
- Corpus - collection of song lyrics from every rapper
- Word Matrix - matrix format of every word used in the Corpus

We will move back and forth between cleaning and structuring data, as we can't efficiently clean badly structured data.


```python
def merge_lyrics(list_of_lyrics):
    merged_text = ' '.join(list_of_lyrics)
    return merged_text

merged_data = {key: [merge_lyrics(value)] for (key, value) in data.items()}
```

Let's try it out. We will print the data before and after executing this function.


```python
data['tupac']
```

That's better. Our data in the moment is in the dictionary format. We will put it in pandas dataframe, or we will re-structure it. 

We kinda already have our data in the Corpus format, now we will create Pandas dataframe from it. Why? Because it will be easier to clean our data if it is structured in a dataframe.


```python
pandas.set_option('max_colwidth',150)

lyrics_dataframe = pandas.DataFrame.from_dict(merged_data).transpose()
lyrics_dataframe.columns = ['lyrics']
lyrics_dataframe = lyrics_dataframe.sort_index()
```

We will check to see if our dataframe is what we expect it to be.


```python
lyrics_dataframe

Now that we have our data restructured we move on to the second data cleaning technique that we will apply: remove garbage characters.


```python
def remove_garbage_characters(lyrics):
    # remove data in brackets
    lyrics = re.sub('\[.*?\]', '', lyrics)
    # remove multiple "\n" characters with ''
    lyrics = re.sub('\n{2,}', '', lyrics)
    # remove single "\n" character with ' '
    lyrics = re.sub('\n', ' ', lyrics)
    return lyrics

garbage_characters_removal_technique = lambda x: remove_garbage_characters(x)

clean_data = pandas.DataFrame(lyrics_dataframe.lyrics.apply(garbage_characters_removal_technique))

Bein\' real don\'t appeal to the brother in you You gotta operate the easy way "I made a G today," but you made it in a sleazy way Sellin\' crack to the kids "I gotta get paid!" — well hey, but that\'s the way it isThat\'s just the way it is Things\'ll never be the same That\'s just the way it is, aww yeah That\'s just the way it is Things\'ll never be the same That\'s just the way it is, aww yeahWe gotta make a change It\'s time for us as a people to start makin\' some changes Let\'s change the way we eat Let\'s change the way we live And let\'s change the way we treat each other You see the old way wasn\'t workin\' So it\'s on us to do what we gotta do to surviveAnd still I see no changes; can\'t a brother get a little peace? It\'s war on the streets and a war in the Middle East Instead of war on poverty They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me And I ain\'t never did a crime I ain\'t have to do But now I\'m back with the facts, givin\' it back to you Don\'t let \'em jack you up, back you up Crack you up and pimp-smack you up You gotta learn to hold your own They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone But tell the cops they can\'t touch this I don\'t trust this, when they try to rush I bust this That\'s the sound of my tool You say it ain\'t cool, my mama didn\'t raise no fool And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped And I never get to lay back ‘Cause I always got to worry \'bout the payback Some buck that I roughed up way back Comin\' back after all these years "Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat," that\'s the way it isThat\'s just the way it is Things\'ll never be the same That\'s just the way it is, aww yeah (You\'re my brother, you\'re my sister) That\'s just the way it is Things\'ll never be the same That\'s just the way it is, aww yeahSome things\'ll never change Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side Somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die And even though we both came from the same places The money and the fame made us all change places How could it be? Through the misery that came to pass The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask For currency, but you could run to me when you need And I\'ll never leave, honestly Someone to believe in, as you can see It\'s a small thing to a true, what could I do? Real homies help you get through And come to knew he\'d do the same thing if he could ‘Cause in the hood, true homies make you feel good And half the times we be actin\' up, call the cops Bringin\' a cease to the peace that was on my block It never stops, when my mama ask me will I change I tell her yeah, but it\'s clear I\'ll always be the same Until the end of timeSo take these broken wings I need your hands to come and heal me once again (Until the end of time) So I can fly away, until the end of time Until the end of time, until the end of timePlease, Lord, forgive me for my life of sin My hard stare seem to scare all my sister\'s kids So you know, I don\'t hang around the house much This all-night money makin\' got me outta touch Shit, ain\'t flashed a smile in a long while An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs My attitude got me walkin\' solo Ride out alone in my lo-lo Watchin\' the whole world move in slow-mo For quiet times, disappear, listen to the ocean Smokin\' Ports, think my thoughts, then it\'s back to coastin\' Who can I trust in this cold world? My phony homie had a baby by my old girl But I ain\'t trippin\', I\'m a player, I ain\'t sweatin\' him I sexed his sister, had her mumble like a Mexican His next of kin, no remorse, it was meant to happen Besides rappin\', the only thing I did good was scrappin\' Until the end of timeSo take these broken wings I need your hands to come and heal me once again (Until the end of time) So I can fly away, until the end of time Until the end of time, until the end of timeNow who\'s to say if I was right or wrong To live my life as an outlaw all along? Remain strong in this planet full of player haters They conversate, but Death Row full of demonstrators And in the end, drinkin\' Hennessy Made all my enemies envy me So cold when I flow, eliminatin\' easily Falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breathe While beggin\' me to keep the peace (haha) When I conceive closer to achieve In times of danger, don\'t freeze, time to be a G Follow my lead, I\'ll supply everything you need An ounce of game and the training to make a G Remember me as an outcast Outlaw Another album out, that\'s what I\'m about: more Gettin\' raw \'til the day I see my casket Buried as a G while the whole world remembers me Until the end of timeSo take these broken wings I need your hands to come and heal me once again (Until the end of time) So I can fly away, until the end of time Until the end of time, until the end of time You are appreciated When I was young, me and my mama had beef Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets Though back at the time I never thought I\'d see her face Ain\'t a woman alive that could take my mama\'s place Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool With the big boys breakin\' all the rules I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years We was poorer than the other little kids And even though we had different daddies, the same drama When things went wrong we\'d blame Mama I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell Huggin\' on my mama from a jail cell And who\'d think in elementary, hey I\'d see the penitentiary one day? And runnin\' from the police, that\'s right Mama catch me, put a whoopin\' to my backside And even as a crack fiend, Mama You always was a black queen, Mama I finally understand For a woman it ain\'t easy tryin\' to raise a man You always was committed A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it There\'s no way I can pay you back, but the plan Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciatedLady, don\'t you know we love ya? (Dear Mama) Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated) Sweet lady, don\'t you know we love ya?Now, ain\'t nobody tell us it was fair No love from my daddy, ‘cause the coward wasn\'t there He passed away and I didn\'t cry, ‘cause my anger Wouldn\'t let me feel for a stranger They say I\'m wrong and I\'m heartless, but all along I was lookin\' for a father, he was gone I hung around with the thugs And even though they sold drugs They showed a young brother love I moved out and started really hangin\' I needed money of my own, so I started slangin\' I ain\'t guilty, ‘cause even though I sell rocks It feels good puttin\' money in your mailbox I love payin\' rent when the rent is due I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you ‘Cause when I was low you was there for me And never left me alone, because you cared for me And I could see you comin\' home after work late You\'re in the kitchen, tryin\' to fix us a hot plate You just workin\' with the scraps you was given And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin\' But now the road got rough, you\'re alone You\'re tryin\' to raise two bad kids on your own And there\'s no way I can pay you back, but my plan Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciatedLady, don\'t you know we love ya? (Dear Mama) Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated) Sweet lady, don\'t you know we love ya?Pour out some liquor and I reminisce ‘Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama And when it seems that I\'m hopeless You say the words that can get me back in focus When I was sick as a little kid To keep me happy there\'s no limit to the things you did And all my childhood memories Are full of all the sweet things you did for me And even though I act crazy I gotta thank the Lord that you made me There are no words that can express how I feel You never kept a secret, always stayed real And I appreciate how you raised me And all the extra love that you gave me I wish I could take the pain away If you can make it through the night, there\'s a brighter day Everything will be alright if you hold on It\'s a struggle every day, gotta roll on And there\'s no way I can pay you back, but my plan Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciatedLady, don\'t you know we love ya?

nights Whether you wrong or you right A motherfucker still love you still feel you Still there for you no matter what hehe You will always be in my heart with unconditional loveCome listen to my truest thoughts my truest feelings All my peers doin years beyond drug dealing How many caskets can we witness Before we see its hard to live this life without God So we must ask forgiveness Ask Mama why I got this urge to die Witness the tears fallin free from my eyes before she could reply Though we were born without a silver spoon My broken down TV show cartoons in my living room hey One day I hope to make it a player in this game Mama dont cry long as we try maybe things change Perhaps its just a fantasy A life where we dont need no welfare and share with our whole family Maybe its me that caused it the fightin and the hurtin In my room cryin because I didnt wanna be a burden Watch Mama open up her arms to hug me And I aint worried bout a damn thing with unconditional loveIn this game the lessons in your eyes to see Though things change the futures still inside of me We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark So you will always be in my heart with unconditional love In this game the lessons in your eyes to see Though things change the futures still inside of me We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark So you will always be in my heart with unconditional loveJust got the message youve been callin all week Been out here hustlin on these streets Aint had a chance to speak But you know with you and me its all G We could never be enemies Cause youve been such a good friend to me Where would I be without my dogs No wonder why when times get hard Cause it aint easy bein who we are Driven by my ambitions desire higher positions So I proceed to make Gs eternally And my mission is to be more than just a rap musician The elevation of todays generation if I could make em listen Prison aint what we need no longer stuck in greed Time to plan strategize my familys gotta eat We work somethin out of nothin No pleasure in the sufferin Neighborhood would be good if they could cut out all the bustin The liquor and the weed the cussin Sendin love out to my block The struggle never stops unconditional loveIn this game the lessons in your eyes to see Though things change the futures still inside of me We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark So you will always be in my heart with unconditional love In this game the lessons in your eyes to see Though things change the futures still inside of me We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark So you will always be in my heart with unconditional loveIll probably never understand your ways With everyday I swear I hear you tryin to change your ways While gettin paid at the same time Just had a baby with the same eyes Somethin inside please let me die these are strange times How come I never made it Maybe its the way I played it in my heart I knew one day I gotta be a star My hopes and all my wishes so many vivid pictures And all the currency Ill never even get to see This fast life soon shatters cause after all the lights and screams nothin but my dreams matter Hopin for better days maybe a peaceful night Baby dont cry cause everything gon be alright Just lay your head on my shoulder Dont worry bout a thing baby girl Im a soldier huh Never treated me bad no matter who I was You still came with that unconditional love repeat to fade In this game the lessons in your eyes to see Though things change the futures still inside of me We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark So you will always be in my heart with unconditional love In this game the lessons in your eyes to see Though things change the futures still inside of me We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark So you will always be in my heart with unconditional love I see no changes wake up in the morning and I ask myself Is life worth livin Should I blast myself Im tired of bein poor and even worse Im black My stomach hurts so Im lookin for a purse to snatch Cops give a damn about a negro Pull the trigger kill a nigga hes a hero Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares One less

hungry mouth on the welfare First ship em dope and let em deal to brothers Give em guns step back watch em kill each other Its time to fight back thats what Huey said Two shots in the dark now Hueys dead I got love for my brother But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other We gotta start makin changes Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers And thats how its supposed to be How can the Devil take a brother if hes close to me Id love to go back to when we played as kids But things change and thats the way it isThats just the way it is Thingsll never be the same Thats just the way it is aww yeah Thats just the way it is Thingsll never be the same Thats just the way it is aww yeahI see no changes all I see is racist faces Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races We under I wonder what it takes to make this One better place lets erase the wasted Take the evil out the people theyll be actin right Cause both black and white are smokin crack tonight And the only time we chill is when we kill each other It takes skill to be real time to heal each other And although it seems heavensent We aint ready to see a black president It aint a secret dont conceal the fact The penitentiarys packed and its filled with blacks But some things will never change Try to show another way but you stayin in the dope game Now tell me whats a mother to do Bein real dont appeal to the brother in you You gotta operate the easy way I made a G today but you made it in a sleazy way Sellin crack to the kids I gotta get paid — well hey but thats the way it isThats just the way it is Thingsll never be the same Thats just the way it is aww yeah Thats just the way it is Thingsll never be the same Thats just the way it is aww yeahWe gotta make a change Its time for us as a people to start makin some changes Lets change the way we eat Lets change the way we live And lets change the way we treat each other You see the old way wasnt workin So its on us to do what we gotta do to surviveAnd still I see no changes cant a brother get a little peace Its war on the streets and a war in the Middle East Instead of war on poverty They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me And I aint never did a crime I aint have to do But now Im back with the facts givin it back to you Dont let em jack you up back you up Crack you up and pimpsmack you up You gotta learn to hold your own They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone But tell the cops they cant touch this I dont trust this when they try to rush I bust this Thats the sound of my tool You say it aint cool my mama didnt raise no fool And as long as I stay black I gotta stay strapped And I never get to lay back Cause I always got to worry bout the payback Some buck that I roughed up way back Comin back after all these years Ratatattattattat thats the way it isThats just the way it is Thingsll never be the same Thats just the way it is aww yeah Youre my brother youre my sister Thats just the way it is Thingsll never be the same Thats just the way it is aww yeahSome thingsll never change Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side Somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die And even though we both came from the same places The money and the fame made us all change places How could it be Through the misery that came to pass The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask For currency but you could run to me when you need And Ill never leave honestly Someone to believe in as you can see Its a small thing to a true what could I do Real homies help you get through And come to knew hed do the same thing if he could Cause in the hood true homies make you feel good And half the times we be actin up call the cops Bringin a cease to the peace that was on my block It never stops when my mama ask me will I change I tell her yeah but its clear Ill always be the same Until the end of timeSo take these broken wings I need your hands to come and heal me once again Until the end of time So I can fly away until the end of time Until the end of time until the end of timePlease Lord forgive me for my life of sin My hard stare seem to scare all my sisters kids So you know I dont hang around the house much This allnight money makin got me outta touch Shit aint flashed a smile in a long while An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs My attitude got me walkin solo Ride out alone in my lolo Watchin the whole world move in slowmo For quiet times disappear listen to the ocean Smokin Ports think my thoughts then its back to coastin Who can I trust in this cold world My phony homie had a baby by my old girl But I aint trippin Im a player I aint sweatin him I sexed his sister had her mumble like a Mexican His next of kin no remorse it was meant to happen Besides rappin the only thing I did good was scrappin Until the end of timeSo take these broken wings I need your hands to come and heal me once again Until the end of time So I can fly away until the end of time Until the end of time until the end of timeNow whos to say if I was right or wrong To live my life as an outlaw all along Remain strong in this planet full of player haters They conversate but Death Row full of demonstrators And in the end drinkin Hennessy Made all my enemies envy me So cold when I flow eliminatin easily Falls to they knees they plead for they right to breathe While beggin me to keep the peace haha When I conceive closer to achieve In times of danger dont freeze time to be a G Follow my lead Ill supply everything you need An ounce of game and the training to make a G Remember me as an outcast Outlaw Another album out thats what Im about more Gettin raw til the day I see my casket Buried as a G while the whole world remembers me Until the end of timeSo take these broken wings I need your hands to come and heal me once again Until the end of time So I can fly away until the end of time Until the end of time until the end of time You are appreciated When I was young me and my mama had beef Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets Though back at the time I never thought Id see her face Aint a woman alive that could take my mamas place Suspended from school and scared to go home I was a fool With the big boys breakin all the rules I shed tears with my baby sister over the years We was poorer than the other little kids And even though we had different daddies the same drama When things went wrong wed blame Mama I reminisce on the stress I caused it was hell Huggin on my mama from a jail cell And whod think in elementary hey Id see the penitentiary one day And

there He passed away and I didnt cry cause my anger Wouldnt let me feel for a stranger They say Im wrong and Im heartless but all along I was lookin for a father he was gone I hung around with the thugs And even though they sold drugs They showed a young brother love I moved out and started really hangin I needed money of my own so I started slangin I aint guilty cause even though I sell rocks It feels good puttin money in your mailbox I love payin rent when the rent is due I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you Cause when I was low you was there for me And never left me alone because you cared for me And I could see you comin home after work late Youre in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate You just workin with the scraps you was given And Mama made miracles

And all my childhood memories Are full of all the sweet things you did for me And even though I act crazy I gotta thank the Lord that you made me There are no words that can express how I feel You never kept a secret always stayed real And I appreciate how you raised me And all the extra love that you gave me I wish I could take the pain away If you can make it through the night theres a brighter day Everything will be alright if you hold on Its a struggle every day gotta roll on And theres no way I can pay you back but my plan Is to show you that I understand you are appreciatedLady

Now let's move on to the last step of our data cleaning process: remove stop words. But, before we do that, we have to organize our data in a word matrix. We will use CountVectorizer to tokenize the lyrics and we can remove the stop words with the same module. Every row will contain data for a rapper and every column will be a different word.


```python
cv = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english')
tokenized_data = cv.fit_transform(clean_data.lyrics)
word_matrix = pandas.DataFrame(tokenized_data.toarray(), columns=cv.get_feature_names())
word_matrix.index = clean_data.index
```

Let's see our word matrix:

Finally, we will save all data to files:


```python
word_matrix.to_pickle("word_matrix.pkl")

clean_data.to_pickle('clean_data.pkl')
pickle.dump(cv, open("cv.pkl", "wb"))
```
